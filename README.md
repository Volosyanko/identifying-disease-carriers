# identifying-disease-carriers

With this mini project my main aim was to use **principal component analysis** along with three different classification methods (**LDA, QDA** and **Na√Øve Bayes**) to detect carriers for a particular disease using the following two datasets, [carriers-dataset.txt](https://github.com/Volosyanko/identifying-disease-carriers/blob/main/carriers-dataset.txt) and [normals-dataset.txt](https://github.com/Volosyanko/identifying-disease-carriers/blob/main/normals-dataset.txt). The code is found in ['code.R'](https://github.com/Volosyanko/identifying-disease-carriers/blob/main/code.R) and the report explaining my findings is found in ['short-report.pdf'](https://github.com/Volosyanko/identifying-disease-carriers/blob/main/short-report.pdf).
